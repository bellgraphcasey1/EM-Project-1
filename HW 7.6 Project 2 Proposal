Who are the partners in this team?
  Ben Sims and Casey Bellgraph
  
What are you and your partner proposing to do?
  We are going to continue Casey's work on the E&M properties of magnetars.

What area of E&M will you be conducting original calculations for?
  Work on magnetars, specifically for dynamo action in relation to the magnetic fields of neutron stars.

What source material are you drawing from?
  Everything listed in Casey's paper:

What has been done so far and what are you going to do? It’s ok if it’s a solved problem, but you will need to reproduce what has been done and extend it beyond what your reference material offers.
  So far, a nice theory has been set as to how dynamo action amplifies the magnetic field from that of a pulsar into a magnetar.
  We are going to examine the relation between speed, radius, and other factors to that of the magnetic field of these neutron stars.
  We hope to do this with several graphs and hopefully begin with a simple model that we can make more complex to model said dynamo action.

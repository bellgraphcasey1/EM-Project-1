# Feedback on Project Work
## Casey Bellgraph

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Casey, your summaries are very nicely done and clearly written. I think you found a couple of papers that work well for your project. I do want to ask that you try to dig a bit more into the theory and the models surrounding magnetars. I think you have a nice overview, but the paper will be strengthened if you can start digging into the theory, models, and their predictions. If you can also couple that that to an explanantion of observations that's even better. But I do want to push you to think through the mathematical models and physical theories (you can just pick one or you can compare two) that describe these. Given what you've read, there's probably an interesting history here that is worth describing; hence, the suggestion of comparing models.

## Assignment 1

Casey, this work on magnetars seems very interesting. I think that the thing you will have to think about as you are working on your paper and reading is what specifically about magnetars are you going to talk about. Having some specific idea or ideas to talk about in some detail will be needed to make sure there's an E&M focus of your paper. The references that you have a good start, but also cover a broad range of topics. I would suggest that you start by reading the Kouveliotou article as it appears to be an overview and then decide on a specific direction and read a second paper (probably one referenced in that article) that covers that direction.

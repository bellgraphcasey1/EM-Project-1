## Assignment 1

Casey, this work on magnetars seems very interesting. I think that the thing you will have to think about as you are working on your paper and reading is what specifically about magnetars are you going to talk about. Having some specific idea or ideas to talk about in some detail will be needed to make sure there's an E&M focus of your paper. The references that you have a good start, but also cover a broad range of topics. I would suggest that you start by reading the Kouveliotou article as it appears to be an overview and then decide on a specific direction and read a second paper (probably one referenced in that article) that covers that direction.

* Score: 20/20
